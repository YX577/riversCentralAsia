# Background

Central Asia has a rich hydrometeorological record. Discharge at selected important rivers started to be measured round the beginning of the 20th century. These data are archived in the hydrometeorological agencies of the region. The goal of this package is to make these data available to students from Central Asia to learn about the fascinating hydrology in their region and to make quantitative analyses possible using these data.
